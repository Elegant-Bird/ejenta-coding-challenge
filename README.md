# EJENTA Coding Challenge

Ejenta is throwing a party! But we have to first figure out whom to invite. We have N people to choose from and we also have a list of which pairs of people know each other. Assume that if person A knows person B, then person B also knows person A. We would like to invite as many people as possible subject to the following constraint: each person at the party needs to know at least five people that are also attending the party.


Implement an algorithm that takes a list of people and a list of pairs of people that know each other. The goal is to output the list of people that we should invite to the party.



Keep in mind the following two requirements:

1. We must maximize the number of people we invite, while conforming to rule #2 below.

2. Everyone invited must know at least five people who are also invited.


You may assume that if someone is invited, they will attend the party.



You can represent this information any way you want, but we will be evaluating the code for both correctness and style. For this problem you should emphasize style and maintainability over efficiency.


You may use whatever programming language you like.



P.S. Test cases are not required but a non-trivial test could help you think through the problem carefully.


# exclusive-party

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
